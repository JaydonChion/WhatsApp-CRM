## General info

This app will help businesses to use only one customer-facing WhatsApp number to receive messages among multiple support
agents in real-time.

It will remove the need for multiple agents to share one phone as they will be able to receive customer messages on the
app wherever they are.

Businesses also do not need to have multiple WhatsApp numbers as only one can do!

## Technologies

* Firebase Firestore RTDB
* Express - v4.17.1
* React - v17.0.1
* Puppeteer - v7.0.0
* WhatsApp
